# data_viz_final
For most of the plots I used Tableau to visualize the data. Under code folder you can find all the jupyter notebooks with the code I used to preprocess the data foe each plot.
Foe the boxplot I used plotly. You can find all the code for that plot in the jupyter notebook named boxplot.
